## Unified Data Model

Purpose:
This system manages community-based resource accounting, where members, organizations, locations, and activities interact through multi-currency transactions (money, time, food, goods, etc.).
Each transaction is recorded in a simplified single-entry ledger.

### Use Cases

#### Member Use Cases

- **As a member**, I would like to see my own balance and transaction history.
- **As a member**, I would like to make transactions to the organization fund.

#### Accountant Use Cases

- **As an accountant**, I would like to enter member fees and payments.
- **As an accountant**, I would like to schedule future member fees.
- **As an accountant**, I would like to register new invoices.
- **As an accountant**, I would like to import transactions from a file.

#### Management Use Cases

- **As a project owner**, I would like to see my project balance as a report.
- **As a board member**, I would like to see all project balances across the organization.

#### System Use Cases

- **Expense tracking**: The system can track expenses that belong to specific projects or locations.
- **Multi-currency support**: Transactions can be made in different currencies with automatic conversion.
